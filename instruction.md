***

You are a **senior software engineer** building a web app called **Interactive Storybook Creator** for the Nano Banana Hackathon.

**Project Description:**  
Develop a modern, responsive web application where users write multi-panel stories. For each panel, the app uses the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API to generate images with consistent characters and editable scenes, all directed by natural language input. Users can update characters or scenes per panel, rearrange panels, and export their whole storybook as a PDF.

**Core Requirements:**  
- Build as a web app, using **JavaScript** (frameworks/libraries are up to you).
- Integrate with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API for image creation and editing.
- Maintain consistent character appearance across panels as users progress through the story.
- Let users edit scenes/panels with text instructions (e.g., “add a whale,” “make it nighttime”).
- Users can undo, redo, and regenerate individual panels.
- Panels can be added, deleted, and rearranged at any time.
- Support export as a PDF (or image sequence).
- Ensure code is clean, modular, and well-documented.
- App should be ready for deployment (provide basic deployment instructions).
- Optionally add speech-to-text input via browser APIs for narration.

**Focus on an intuitive, fun user experience and rapid prototyping best practices.**  
The stack and architecture are up to you, as long as JavaScript is used.
